      The story
    </p>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
      That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
      They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
      The farmer said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
      The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
      The farmer again said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</p>

      <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
      The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
      The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
      Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

      <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you
      never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it... - Alan Watts
